# What if the Universe was 1D initially?

then, 

- we could define the usual action for 1D and call it effective
- we could define a novel action for general d-dimensions

## the kinetic term

$e^{ix}=\cos x + i \sin x$

extend the sum to non-integers

essentially allows defining the fractional Lagrangian
$L(s) = \int$
and now the physics in fractional dimensions can be calculated
